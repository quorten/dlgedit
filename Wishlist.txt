These features are unnecessary, but they are convenient:

* Allow multiple selections and dragging multiple controls.  This is
  not necessary, as it can be done by manual arithmetic with the text
  window.

* Provide push-buttons that perform alignment and spacing on the
  current selection.  This is also unnecessary for the same reason
  stated above.

* Provide an in-program full dialog template text editor.  Currently,
  the program only lets you edit either a single control at a time or
  the dialog header.  However, you can simply open up the template in
  an external editor, make the necessary changes, then reload the
  template in the dialog editor, making this feature therefore
  unnecessary.

* Provide better WYSIWYG rendering support.

* Provide an interface to graphically embed the Dialog Editor within
  an Emacs session.

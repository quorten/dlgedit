There are some features that I may want to add in consideration to
architecture.txt:

* More "human" text messages.  Overly sparse textual information makes
  the program seem like computers are emotionless, which they are, but
  this does not make for a very good user experience.  Being more
  informative and more verbose as appropriate would help, such as
  saying the name of the current file in the application's title bar.

* Saving the window position and text window font on exit and loading
  it on start.

* Break up LoadDialogTemplate() and SaveDialogTemplate() into their
  proper modules.  Note that because LoadDialogTemplate() uses
  platform dependent functions, it cannot be used in tmplparser.c, and
  because SaveDialogTemplate() has a single line of code that changes
  the state of the "fileChanged" variable, that would need a
  bootstrapper function into the one function in tmplparser.c.
